3. Download PhaME

4. Go to PhaME top directory. In the top directory, you should find the folder "test", "src", etc.

5. Create the folder "workdirs" and "/workdirs/mytest". For example: $mkdir -p ./test/workdirs/mytest

6. Copy your data to /workdirs/mytest/

7. Create a new control file and set all parameters in it. For example: a control file "test/ctl_files/mytest3.ctl"

8. Run the command phame in the folder "src". For example: $perl src/phame test/ctl_files/mytest3.ctl

Note: Candida fungi test showed that only fasta data works, while its fastq data from PacBio long sequencing do not work. Possible reason is that PhaME only handle paired/single reads from Illumina.
