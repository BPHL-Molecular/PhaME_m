# PhaME_m
The updated version of PhaME (Phylogenetic and Molecular Evolution analysis tool). PhaME_m retains all the functions of PhaME, namely performing phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analysis from sequencing reads, draft assemblies or completed genomes. The sequencing data in FASTQ or FASTA format can be directly inputted. 

# Why PhaME_m?
Since PheME has not been updated for a long time, the existing versions (precompiled, development, and docker versions) have some installation and running issues. In PheME_m, all of these issues are solved. According to the new installation guide, the PheME can be successfully installed and run on a local machine.
